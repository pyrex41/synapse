summary: >-
  Quarterly architecture review assessing SalesPro platform health,
  technical debt, and Q1 priorities. USE A MEETING doc to capture
  structured notes from a significant meeting - observations across
  domains, metrics reviewed, health assessments, risks identified, and
  decisions made. Meeting docs answer "what was discussed and decided?"
  They create a record that can be referenced by action items, TDDs,
  and capability assessments. Compare: a Report synthesizes trends over
  time; a Meeting doc captures a single session. Action items from
  meetings often spawn TDDs, ADRs, or backlog tickets.

## Meeting Details

- **Project**: SalesPro Platform
- **Topic**: Q1 Architecture Review and Technical Debt Assessment
- **Date/Time**: 2025-01-15 2:00 PM CT
- **Attendees (engineering)**: Principal Engineer, Tech Lead (Backend), Tech Lead (Frontend), DevOps Lead
- **Attendees (product)**: Head of Product, Product Manager
- **Context**: Post-MVP review to assess platform health before scaling to MSP milestone. 3 engineers currently, ramping to 5 in Q1.

## Observations by Domain

- **Backend / API**: NestJS API is stable with good module separation. MikroORM migrations are clean. Entity relationships for CRM module are solid. However, the event system is still using direct service calls rather than the designed queue architecture - this needs to happen before MSP.
- **Frontend / Web**: React + MUI component library is maturing. AG-Grid integration for price guides is working well. Auth flows are complete including MFA. Technical debt: some components are doing direct API calls instead of going through the service layer.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL schema is well-normalized. Seeding infrastructure is comprehensive (7 seed scripts). Index coverage is adequate for current load but will need review at 10x scale. No read replica strategy yet.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose setup works for dev. No Kubernetes yet - needed before production. CI/CD pipeline runs tests but doesn't deploy automatically. Worktree-based parallel development workflow is proving effective.
- **Testing**: Unit test coverage is at 65% for API, 40% for frontend. Integration tests exist for critical paths (auth, RBAC, estimates). E2E tests cover login and roles. Gap: no load testing or chaos testing.
- **Security**: JWT auth with HTTP-only cookies is solid. RBAC system with Laratrust-style permissions is complete. MFA with trusted devices implemented. Gap: no secrets rotation policy, no dependency vulnerability scanning in CI.

## Key Metrics & Data Points

- **Test coverage**: 65% unit (API), 40% unit (frontend), 12 integration test suites
- **Build time**: CI pipeline runs in ~4 minutes
- **Tech debt tickets**: 23 open, 8 rated high priority
- **Dependency freshness**: 2 packages more than 1 major version behind (MikroORM, Vite)
- **API endpoints**: 47 implemented, 31 remaining for MSP
- **Entity count**: 28 MikroORM entities defined

## Preliminary Scorecard Hooks

- API Architecture: 4/5 - Clean module boundaries, good patterns, event system needs migration to queues
- Frontend Architecture: 3/5 - Component library maturing but service layer discipline is inconsistent
- Data Layer: 4/5 - Well-normalized schema, comprehensive seeding, needs read replica strategy
- Infrastructure: 2/5 - Dev-only setup, no production infrastructure yet, CI doesn't auto-deploy
- Testing: 3/5 - Good critical path coverage, gaps in load testing and E2E breadth
- Security: 4/5 - Strong auth implementation, RBAC complete, needs dependency scanning

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Owner | Mitigation | Due Date |
|------|----------|------------|-------|------------|----------|
| Event system on direct calls won't scale for MSP workflows | High | High | Tech Lead (Backend) | Implement SQS queue architecture per event-architecture-final TDD | 2025-02-28 |
| No production infrastructure | High | Certain | DevOps Lead | Set up Kubernetes cluster, ArgoCD, monitoring stack | 2025-03-15 |
| Frontend service layer inconsistency | Medium | Medium | Tech Lead (Frontend) | Establish and enforce service layer pattern, add lint rule | 2025-02-14 |
| No dependency vulnerability scanning | Medium | Medium | DevOps Lead | Add Dependabot + npm audit to CI pipeline | 2025-01-31 |

## Decisions & Next Steps

### Decisions

- Event system migration to SQS is the top engineering priority for Q1 - blocks MSP milestone
- Production infrastructure (K8s + monitoring) must be ready by March 15
- Hire a dedicated DevOps/SRE engineer in Q1 to own infrastructure
- Adopt trunk-based development with feature flags instead of long-lived feature branches

### Action Items

- Create TDD for event system migration to SQS (Tech Lead Backend - 2025-01-22)
- ADR for Kubernetes vs ECS decision (DevOps Lead - 2025-01-24)
- Set up Dependabot and npm audit in CI (DevOps Lead - 2025-01-31)
- Audit frontend components for direct API calls, create refactor tickets (Tech Lead Frontend - 2025-02-07)
- Write load testing plan for payment and estimate flows (QA - 2025-02-14)

### Follow-ups

- Bi-weekly architecture sync to track event system migration progress
- Monthly tech debt review (rotate facilitator across tech leads)
- Next quarterly architecture review: April 15, 2025

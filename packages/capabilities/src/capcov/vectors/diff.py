"""Deltas between two store inspections, and the first difference of two results.

``store_delta`` turns a before/after pair of fixture inspections into what
changed, split into the stores the operation DECLARES it touches (compared at
replay) and everything else (carried as informational, so an undeclared touch
becomes a finding rather than vanishing). ``first_difference`` names the first
node at which a candidate's result departs from the recorded one; replay stops
at the first because one path a person can read beats a wall of diff.

An inspection is the shape ``fixture.Fixture.inspect`` returns::

    {"rows":        {table: [row, ...]},        # relational stores
     "collections": {name: [document, ...]},    # document stores
     "queues":      {name: depth},              # pending work
     "redis_keys":  [key, ...]}                 # cache key set

Rows are keyed by their ``id`` when they have one, else by a hash of the row, so
an insert, an update and a delete are told apart. Documents are compared as an
append-only log (appended tail, removed count, rewritten prefix), because that
is what an audit collection is; a collection that is not append-only shows a
``rewritten`` count rather than a false "nothing appended". Queue depths and
cache keys are always informational: they are how work moves, not what it did.

``declared`` is ``"*"`` (compare every touched store) or a table of names by
store kind, ``{"rows": [...], "collections": [...]}``. The store-technology
spellings ``tables``/``mysql`` (rows) and ``mongo``/``documents`` (collections)
are accepted so a consumer's inputs may name the technology it declared.
``informational`` is a list of table or collection names that are never
compared even when declared: bookkeeping tables (job status, failed jobs, an
outbox) that change on every run.

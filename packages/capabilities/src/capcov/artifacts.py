"""Artifact formats, provenance, and the tree hash everything is relative to.

There is no complete-in-the-abstract. What this framework asserts is
completeness *with respect to a named artifact*, so every file it writes carries
`derived_from`: the artifact, its hash, the extractor, and when. `reconcile`
refuses to compare two artifacts whose `artifact_sha256` disagree -- a static
run against one tree and a runtime run against another produce a diff that
looks authoritative and means nothing.

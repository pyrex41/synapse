"""Judge a replay receipt with three claim kernels, one of them a compiled Souffle binary.

Three subcommands, stdlib and ``capcov`` only:

``judge``    build the receipt's combined bundle, compile the rule pack's
             program, run python / interpreted Souffle / compiled Souffle,
             certify every claim row from every closure, and write
             ``receipt.json``, the per-row certificates and ``judge.json``.
             ``judge`` is the default, so a caller may omit it.
``bench``    time the interpreter against the binary on a synthetic receipt
             scaled from a fixture, and write ``bench.json``.
``compile``  compile one rule pack's program and print its ``provenance.json``.

Exit codes (``judge``)::

    0  every required op is op_qualified supported/complete in all three kernels
    1  a required op is not supported, not complete, or not replayed at all
    2  the kernels disagree, or the compiled kernel could not be built
    3  the receipt does not meet the exporter's contract (a contract finding)
    4  the toolchain or the judge's own environment is unavailable (no souffle,
       no souffle-compile.py, an unwritable cache or output directory)
    5  every op the verdict turns on is *pending* a premise nothing can satisfy
       yet -- today only the Stage D typed-checker certificate
       (``model_well_formed``; ``replay.join.PENDING_PREMISES``).  Such an op
       passed every premise that says something about this port: the systems
       agreed with the model, nothing outside the reviewer's exclusions was
       written, no mutant survived, the order and stability gates held.  Exit 5
       is deliberately distinct from 1 so a consumer gate can tell "the checker
       does not exist yet" from "this port is not qualified", and 1 wins over 5
       whenever any op the verdict turns on has a real blocker.

The per-op ``qualification`` field of ``judge.json`` carries the same three
states in words: ``qualified``, ``pending <relation>``, ``unsupported``.

``judge.json`` also carries the run's cross-request and learn-campaign context:
each op entry has ``repeat_delete`` (the repeats found, the violations among them
and the targets judged not-found) and ``learn_consistent`` / ``learn_unmodeled``,
and the document has a run-level ``learn`` block naming the campaign, its
counterexamples and the ops it reports as unmodelled.  ``{"present": false}``
there means no campaign is bound to the run, which is not a finding.

Without ``--require-op`` the verdict is derived from every replayed op rather
than from an empty requirement: a verdict over zero requirements would be
vacuously ``supported``, which no party has asserted.

The compiled binary is a third independent evaluator with recorded provenance,
never a replacement for the interpreter or the Python kernel: a compiled-side
failure is a named failure, never a fallback, and ``judge`` exits non-zero
unless all three kernels agree.
